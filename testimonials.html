Her eye for design is impeccable and her passion truly radiates. She is very professional, 100% dependable, and has top-of-the-line communication - beginning to end. Any builder, agent, or homeowner would be in the BEST hands in hiring Ivy League Home Staging & Designs.</p>

She has outstanding customer service, not just to the agent but with the  seller as well and her communication is phenomenal. I highly recommend Ivy Jo and Ivy League Staging!</p>

She is amazing, to say she has an eye for design is an understatement! She can use what you have and make your home look better than you knew possible. And for listings, she is able to bring in full staging for every room, or light staging to spruce up the space! Her pricing is very competitive. She is always quick to respond to questions. Would highly recommend Ivy and her team for staging!"  </p>
